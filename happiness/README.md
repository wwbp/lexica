# Happiness


This archive contains the Happiness lexicon, derived from 2,676 participants who shared Facebook statuses and answered the question: ``The following questions ask about how you felt yesterday on a scale from 0 to 10. Zero means you did not experience Happiness "at all" yesterday while 10 means you experienced Happiness  "all  of  the  time"  yesterday``. Please see the original [paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/18132) for more details.

To learn how to use this lexicon, please refer to the [paper](http://wwbp.org/publications.html#p83). 

Note that the intercept (marked as "\_intercept" in the lexica csvs) is to be added post weighted lexicon extraction.
